## Visuals 

### Photography and Video Content
The photography and video content used on this site are taken from [Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.co.nz/photos/hannah-mcneish?family=editorial&phrase=hannah%20mcneish&sort=best#license) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hannah+mcneish) with the exception of the background images used on the [Home page](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/index.html) and [Contact page](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/contact.html). These images were taken from [Pixbay](https://pixabay.com/photos/news-newsletter-newspaper-1591767/) and [Unsplash.](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/birds-on-a-wire)
The client took all photography used on the Library page and all videos are open source. Videos remain the property of the commissioning media channel but display the reporting work of the client. Copyright infringement has not taken place. 


### Fonts
- The site uses **<span style="font-family: 'Playfair Display'; font-size:1.5em;">Playfair Display</span>** font for all headings with a fall back of **‘sans-serif’**.
- **<span style="font-family: 'Raleway'; font-size:1.25em;">Raleway</span>** is used for the body font with a fall back of **‘Arial’** then **‘sans-serif’**. 
- These fonts were choosen due to their closeness to the types of font used in print press as means of subconsciously conveying the work of the client.


### Colours
The use of colour throughout the site is minimal with the majority of colour coming from the clients own work, this is intentional. The colour that was used by the developer focussed mainly on black and white with gradients of grey. Again, to convey the feeling of print press and the media related work of the client. While traditional print press is becoming less common, the connection between the visual stimulus, in this case the fonts and the colours, and working in the media remain connected.
The colours used were:
- White
- #040404
- rgba(240, 240, 240, 0.3)
- rgb(239, 239, 239)
- rgba(32, 28, 28, 0.315)


### Wireframes
The Wireframe mockups were drafted using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). These provided the foundation for the visual layout of the site with very few changes occuring throughout the build.

## Features

### Features across all pages 
The site has two common features across all three pages, the **navigation bar** and the **footer**. The responsive navigation bar is fixed to the top of all pages keeping the name and role of the client visible at all times, as well as adding ease of navigation to any page on the site, [Home](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/index.html), [Library](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/library.html), [Contact](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/contact.html). Each page link highlights when scrolled over and remains underlined on the active page to let visitors know which page they are currently viewing. 

The branding at the top left of the screen provides a link to the [Home](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/index.html) page from any page on the site. On mobile devices, the navigation menu shifts to a drop down menu visible at the top of the screen at all times. 

The footer contains a **Contact Hannah** link that takes visitors to the [Contact Page](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/contact.html) and has social media links to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en-gb), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/). Colours and fonts are consistent across all pages to ensure familiarity when navigating and a consistent theme across the site.

#### Home Page 
The [Home](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/index.html) page has: 
- A full width hero image with a centred text overlay providing the clients name and the client’s occupation. The image chosen fulfils the immediate visual impression that the client works in media and sets the colour theme throughout the site. The text overlay provides immediate confirmation of the purpose of the site, which is to promote the client. 

- An About section after the hero image provides background to the client in terms of current location and the range of media and topical areas the client works in and reports on. The background image to the About section was chosen based on its inference to **‘wiring information’** and **‘lines of communication’** to keep the overt and covert media theme of the site consistent.
- Below the about section is a profile image of the client alongside a more detailed biography of work history and the types of commissioning agencies that the client has undertaken work for. Below this are links to redirect visitors to the **Library** or **Contact** page.

#### Library Page 
The [Library](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/library.html) page consists of: 
- A ***centred Carousel*** displaying images of the clients work at the top of the page. 
- ***Three YouTube links*** contained in display cards sit below the carousel. These links are fully controlled by the user and can be played from their starting position in the card container or can be opened out to full screen – ***video does not auto play.***
- ***Six article links*** each contained within display cards. Each card contains a photo taken by the client that is relevant to the article, the name of the publisher and year of the publication, a brief abstract and a Read Article button to direct visitors to the article.
- Below this are ***eight cards inviting visitors to view more of the clients work***. Each card contains the logo of the site or publication the user would be directed to and a link button that takes visitors directly to the client’s work hosted on each site.

#### Contact Page 
The [Contact](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/contact.html) page:

- Carries over the background image from the Home page About section and presents it across full width and height of the page.
- Has a simple, clearly visible contact form positioned centrally on the page.  Visitors are asked to complete their Full Name, Reason for Contact (Journalism, Photography, Consultancy or General), Email Address and Message then press Submit 
The form will not be submitted if the Full Name or Email Address fields are missing or incomplete.
