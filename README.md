## Visuals 

### Photography and Video Content
The photography and video content used on this site are taken from [Getty Images](https://www.gettyimages.co.nz/photos/hannah-mcneish?family=editorial&phrase=hannah%20mcneish&sort=best#license) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=hannah+mcneish) with the exception of the background images used on the [Home page](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/index.html) and [Contact page](https://janelleg51.github.io/Hannah-McNeish-Journalist/contact.html). These images were taken from [Pixbay](https://pixabay.com/photos/news-newsletter-newspaper-1591767/) and [Unsplash.](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/birds-on-a-wire)
The client took all photography used on the Library page and all videos are open source. Videos remain the property of the commissioning media channel but display the reporting work of the client. Copyright infringement has not taken place. 


### Fonts
- The site uses **<span style="font-family: 'Playfair Display'; font-size:1.5em;">Playfair Display</span>** font for all headings with a fall back of **‘sans-serif’**.
- **<span style="font-family: 'Raleway'; font-size:1.25em;">Raleway</span>** is used for the body font with a fall back of **‘Arial’** then **‘sans-serif’**. 
- These fonts were choosen due to their closeness to the types of font used in print press as means of subconsciously conveying the work of the client.


### Colours
The use of colour throughout the site is minimal with the majority of colour coming from the clients own work, this is intentional. The colour that was used by the developer focussed mainly on black and white with gradients of grey. Again, to convey the feeling of print press and the media related work of the client. While traditional print press is becoming less common, the connection between the visual stimulus, in this case the fonts and the colours, and working in the media remain connected.
The colours used were:
- White
- #040404
- rgba(240, 240, 240, 0.3)
- rgb(239, 239, 239)
- rgba(32, 28, 28, 0.315)


### Wireframes
The Wireframe mockups were drafted using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). These provided the foundation for the visual layout of the site with very few changes occuring throughout the build.

### Deploying 
To deploy this site to **GitHub** pages, the steps below were taken:

1. The developer logged into **GitHub.**
2. Once logged in, the desired repository was selected from the options available to the left of the screen **JanelleG51-Hannah-McNeish-Journalist**
3. From the possible options available, which included **Code, Issues, Pull requests, Actions, Projects, Wiki, Security, Insights and Settings.** **Settings** was selected.
4. Once in **Settings**, scrolled down the page to **GitHub Pages**.
5. Under **Source**, clicked on the drop-down menu and changed the selection from **None** to **Master Branch**.
6. On selecting **Master Branch**, the page automatically refreshed and the site was deployed.
7. The deployed link then appeared in the **GitHub Pages** section.
